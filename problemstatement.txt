Design an nodejs application to fetch data from a public API eg:   https://catfact.ninja/fact  

1. The function should return a Promise that resolves with the fetched data.

2. Implement retry logic for handling rate-limiting errors. If the API responds with a rate-limiting error (HTTP status code 429), the function should wait for a certain period (e.g., 5 seconds) and then retry the request.
        
3. Implement a maximum retry count (e.g., 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is reached and the rate-limiting error persists, the function should reject the Promise with an appropriate error message.

4. Once the data is successfully fetched from the API, store it in MySQL  database and also export into csv.
